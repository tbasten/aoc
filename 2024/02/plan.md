Rules
- Rule 1 Sequence must go in same direction
- Rule 2 sequence cant jump more the 3 between each int
- Rule 3 sequence must not be the same as the previous int

Each line the following should be done
- slice the int's
- add each int into an ordered list so that we can iterate of it later
- add the list into a list 
- add a new list that initialises the results as false. False will be the default state
- [[List of ints],[Result, Result, Result]]

# My Approach
- Get the initial direction by comparing the first into and second int. If there are less the 0 assign direction as -1, if gt 0 assign 1, if they are the same, assign 0

## Rule 1 - Same Direction
